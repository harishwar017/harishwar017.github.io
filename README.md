# GSoC 2024 with DeepChem

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am **Harishwar Adithya**, and I spent this summer contributing to **DeepChem** as part of **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024**.

## Project Overview

Recently, DeepChem has been transitioning its backend from TensorFlow to PyTorch. As part of this initiative, I worked on **porting the Smiles2Vec model** from TensorFlow to PyTorch.

### My Contributions:

- Ported the **Smiles2Vec** model from TensorFlow to PyTorch.
- Used the **TorchModel** abstraction provided by DeepChem.
- Wrote comprehensive **tests** to ensure that the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the PyTorch model matches the original TensorFlow implementation.

I have documented the entire journey with **weekly updates** in a detailed forum post, which includes an overview of all the tasks and projects I undertook throughout the summer.
